- PURPOSE OF PROJECT: This is a graphical implementation of the famous and innovative game called Tic-Tac-Toe                    
- DATE: 5/6/2020                             
- HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Go to release file, download the binary, and follow instructions in the release.
- AUTHORS: Nhan man                          
- USER INSTRUCTIONS: It's a tic tac toe game.
- PROBLEM: I have to make a tic tac toe program to pass C++.

# How I Make The Masterpiece

## The AI
I actually have much greater plan for the AI. I wanted to make the AI to play the perfect tic tac toe game, however I couldn't be bothered. So, the current AI uses random number generator to move. If you manages to tie to this AI, you are either extremely lucky or absolute trash at tic tac toe.

## The Board
I utilized advanced C++ techniques such as multi-dimensional array and looping to create the ultimate tic tac toe experience.

## The Winning Condition
I just use a bunch of for loops and hope for the best. (Honestly, this was probably the easiest part)

## The DLLs Used
So I use SDL2 and SDL2_image to generate graphics and input. In hindsight, I probably shouldn't use SDL2 because it takes longer to set up SDL2 than it is to make the actual game. Eventually, SDL2 and C++ teamed together to decrease my sanity by a few points. However, I realized that I capitalize on my insanity to push myself to finish the tic tac toe game, and so I did.
